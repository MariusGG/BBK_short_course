# Javascript short course at Birkbeck University 

On this course I developed dynamic webpages using JavaScript, HTML 5 and CSS. The first part of the course guides you through the basic principles and techniques of client-side web programming using JavaScript. Topics covered include: data types, variables, arrays, conditionals, iteration, functions etc. The second part focuses on JavaScript in context, looking at how JavaScript brings interactivity and advanced functionality to the web. Topics covered include: processing user input (forms), navigation, event-handling, Document Object Model, and JQuery.
